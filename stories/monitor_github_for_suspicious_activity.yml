description: "Keep an eye on your GitHub Enterprise environment to identify and investigate unusual or unauthorized activities.
  This analytic story leverages audit data from GitHub to help you monitor critical actions such as repository changes, access to sensitive repositories, privilege escalations, and suspicious login patterns.
  Regularly tracking these activities can help detect compromised accounts, insider threats, or unauthorized access attempts that could put code integrity and intellectual property at risk."
narrative: "As organizations increasingly rely on GitHub for code management, its vital to monitor access and change activities closely.
  Unauthorized changes or unauthorized access to repositories may indicate a compromise or an internal security issue. With this analytic story, you can establish a baseline of typical actions, identify deviations from that norm, and get early warnings about suspicious or malicious behavior in your GitHub environment."
